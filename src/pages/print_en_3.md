  - We, Russians living in Japan, express our gratitude to Japan for giving us the opportunity to peacefully express our disagreement with the war. This is the freedom that has been taken away from us in our country. From the very beginning of the war, we have been opposed to it.

**The full-scale war has been ongoing for three years.** According to official data from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, **12,600 Ukrainian civilians**, including more than **600 children**, have lost their lives. **29,000 people** have been injured. **Thousands** have died after being forced to join the army to defend their country. **6.8 million people** have become refugees. **Millions** more are in need of assistance.

Three years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army, and in light of the rhetoric of several political leaders, we are compelled to remind everyone:

- Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine;
- Vladimir Putin is a dictator who has falsified elections for decades and holds power in Russia illegally;
- Ukraine must be a mandatory participant in any negotiations to end the war;
- Ukraine's conditions for a ceasefire are the most important.

For Russians, this war is a direct consequence of Vladimir Putin's two decades in power. The usurpation of authority, the absence of human rights, repression against dissent, the destruction of independent media, lawlessness, and the dismantling of democratic institutions have led to war.

### Propaganda is the main weapon against peace.

That is why we oppose political pressure on Ukraine.

That is why we support Ukraine in its struggle for the right to be a free, democratic, and European state.

That is why we believe that an integral part of peace must include the immediate and unconditional return of all Ukrainian prisoners held in Russian prisons and the release of all political prisoners in Russia.

### It is important not to forget about this war and to continue supporting the fight for peace and the value of human life.
